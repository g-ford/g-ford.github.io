I've been a software engineer since I was 12 when I copied the code from the Apple IIe manual.  I've been hooked on code since.

You can find my professional career on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/geoffford/) and my code on [Github](https://github.com/g-ford).

Unprofessionally, I have many hobbies ranging from gardening to camping and off roading with the kids.
