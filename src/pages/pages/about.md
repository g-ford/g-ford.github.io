I've been a software engineer since I was 12 when I copied the code from the Apple IIe manual.  I've been hooked on code since.

You can find my professional career on LinkedIn and my code Github.  I have an older [Github Profile](https://github.com/alephnullplex) where you can find some of my older projects.

Unprofessionally, I have many hobbies ranging from gardening to camping and off roading with the kids.
