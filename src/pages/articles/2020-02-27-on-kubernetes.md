Kubernetes is a beast. 

It's easy enough to get a basic cluster stood these days thanks to myriad of cloud offerings - not to mention the gluttony of tools create and manage a cluster.

Then I started looking at services meshes and ingress options and monitoring...next thing I knew the 'simple' single node cluster with 16GB of ram and 8 CPUs was not quite enough.

I'm evaluating options for standing up a platform for microservices.  At this point I'd kind of prefer to use a Serverless platform.  However, in a heavily regulated industry with regulators that are little resistant to change Cloud is still a bit of a dream.

So I think I need to get a lot more aquainted with Kubernetes and istio and maybe ambassador and prometheus and kiali and when does the list finish?!
